### Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning and Fine-tuning Applications with Homomorphic Encryption

This repository contains the implementation of a homomorphic encryption–based, privacy-preserving secure multi-party computation (SMPC) framework designed for federated learning and fine-tuning applications.

The framework enables collaborative model training and adaptation while ensuring that all sensitive data and intermediate computations remain encrypted throughout the process.

## Repository Structure

**fine-tuning/**
Contains the source code for a privacy-preserving fine-tuning application using homomorphic encryption.

**federated-learning/**
